### Power Tools: Hierarchy Folders
A hierarchy folder is an editor-only GameObject meant to help in organizing the GameObjects in your scenes.

### Quick Start Guide
Use the menu item "*GameObject > Hierarchy Folder*" to add new hierarchy folders to the active scene.

Organize your hierarchy by grouping GameObjects under hierarchy folders.

You can also nest hierarchy folders under other hierarchy folders.

Hierarchy folders are stripped from builds, to avoid any negative effects on performance.

### Configuration
You can configure various aspects of the package in the preferences.
To open the preferences view select the menu item "Edit > Preferences..." and select the Hierarchy Folders tab.

### Support
You can contact support using the email support@sisus.co.
